HR Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering -
This project focuses on HR Analytics to uncover valuable insights into employee behavior, satisfaction, performance, and retention using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, the project aims to assist organizations in making data-driven decisions to enhance workforce management and engagement.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handled missing values using imputation techniques (mean, median, mode).
Treated outliers using box plots and interquartile range (IQR) methods.
Standardized features for clustering using StandardScaler.

EDA Techniques:
Univariate Analysis: Analyzed distributions of individual variables like satisfaction level, average monthly hours, and salary.
Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between two variables using scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigated complex interactions using heatmaps, pair plots, and stacked bar charts.

Machine Learning:
Applied K-Means Clustering to segment employees based on satisfaction level, performance evaluation, and workload.
Visualized clusters to identify distinct employee groups and patterns.

Insights and Recommendations:
Highlighted factors influencing employee satisfaction and turnover.
Provided actionable insights for workload distribution, career progression, and retention strategies.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Project Outputs
Visualizations:
Histograms, density plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to reveal trends and distributions.
Clustering scatter plots for employee segmentation.

Insights:
Employees with low satisfaction and high working hours are more likely to leave.
Promotions significantly impact employee satisfaction and retention.

Dataset:
The dataset contains 10 key features, including satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure, promotions, work accidents, department, and salary.
